### Free
**Name** | **Notes** |
| ------------- | :-------------| 
Powershell ISE | Add ScriptBrowser and this is a very robust environment for PowerShell  |
NotePad++ | There is a PowerShell component but it is limited. If you are already using this tool the plugin is handy. |
Visual Studio Code | Free and covers pretty much any language and format you would encounter. Can be heavy and if just starting starting out with PowerShell this wouldn't be my recommendation.|
| Idera PowerShell Plus | Used to be a premium but now free, lots of dba features |


### Premium
